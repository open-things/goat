state of the project
====================

Currently the state is at about _alpha_ or _beta_. The project has not been
used in any type of production environment. Use it at your own risk. For
documentation - currently there is none. You can look at
[flow_test.go](flow_test.go) - it might give you the idea of how goat is
supposed to be used.
